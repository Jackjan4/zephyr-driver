        Power-down mode select.
        0 - normal mode
        1 - Vout is loaded with 1 kOhm resistor to ground
        2 - Vout is loaded 100 kOhm resistor to ground
        3 - Vout is high impedence
        Note: with values bigger than 0 most of channel circuits are powered off
        Note: array entries correspond to the successive channels
